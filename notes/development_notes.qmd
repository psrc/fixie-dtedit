## existing functionalities
- **tabs**: each tab shows the view for a particular error type or circumstance. <br>
only persons with error flags will be displayed. <br>
within each tab, each page shows a person and all their trips
  - [ ] basic information for the person: personid, hhid, pernum, Age, Works(Y/N), Studies(Y/N)
  - [ ] columns in trips table (`FROM [hhts_cleaning].[HHSurvey].[data2fixie]`): 
  <details>
  <summary>list of all columns</summary>
    - tripnum
    - modes_desc
    - daynum
    - depart_dhm
    - arrive_dhm
    - miles
    - mph
    - linear_miles
    - linear_mph
    - Error
    - cotravelers
    - origin_purpose
    - dest_name
    - dest_purpose
    - duration_at_dest
    - origin_coord
    - dest_coord
    - rc
    - elevate_issue
  </details>

- **popup tables**: additional recordsets for person trips
  - [ ] Click on `arrival_hhmm` field: the traces for that trip.
  - [ ] Click on `cotravelers` field: where other household members were or traveling to at that same time
  - [ ] Click on `revision_code` field: the ingredients of a linked trip (revision_code = 8)
    

::: {.callout-important}
- What are the datasets for the popup tables and where?
- see if it is possible to click on cells or show popup table by hovering over cells?

- **trip record editor**
  <details>

    ![trip record editor in Fixie Access](Screenshot_Access_trip_record_editor.png)
  </details>
  - **buttons**
    - [ ] Dismiss Flag
    - [ ] Elevate + Elevate text box
    - [ ] Delete Trip
    - [ ] Split from Traces: This will either split or shorten a trip with a long dwell, depending on whether the dwell was at a different location than the origin or destination.
    - [ ] Link: This links trips if the recids are listed, comma separated, in the Elevate text box.
    - [ ] Unlink: This unlinks trips PSRC has linked--I.e. those with revision_code = 8. It does not split trips that were provided that way to us by RSG.
  
  - **backend processing**: update the derived fields and error flags for that person every time trip editor is closed
